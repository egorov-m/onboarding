# Embedding boards

To integrate onboarding into your product, you have the following option: 
1. Create a project if there was no such thing
![create_project.jpg](./assets/images/create_project.jpg)
2. Publish it if there was no such thing
![published.jpg](./assets/images/published.jpg)
3. Start on the published die
![get_link.jpg](./assets/images/get_link.jpg)

After these actions, you will have a link to the published onboarding in your clipboard and you can use it at your discretion, you can send it or integrate it into page elements.
